Installation
------------

Stable Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the file for your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) from the `latest release <https://github.com/rbreu/beeref/releases>`_. The different Linux versions are built on different versions of Ubuntu. The should work on other distros as well, but you might have to try which one works.

**Linux users** need to give the file executable rights before running it. Optional: If you want to have BeeRef appear in the app menu, save the desktop file from the `release section <https://github.com/rbreu/beeref/releases>`_ in ``~/.local/share/applications``, save the `logo <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreu/beeref/main/beeref/assets/logo.png>`_, and adjust the path names in the desktop file to match the location of your BeeRef installation.

**MacOS X users**, look at `detailed instructions <https://beeref.org/macosx-run.html>`_ if you have problems running BeeRef.

Follow further releases via the `atom feed <https://github.com/rbreu/beeref/releases.atom>`_.


Development Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the current development version, you need to have a working Python 3 environment. Run the following command to install the development version::

  pip install git+https://github.com/rbreu/beeref.git

Then run ``beeref`` or ``beeref filename.bee``.


Features
--------

* Move, scale, rotate, crop and flip images
* Mass-scale images to the same width, height or size
* Mass-arrange images vertically, horizontally or for optimal usage of space
* Add text notes
* Enable always-on-top-mode and disable the title bar to let the BeeRef window unobtrusively float above your art program:
New
---
* Basic snap-to-grid when moving **images**. Press '**CTRL**' while moving the image, uses the 'Settings: arrange_gap' for the grid-size.
* Export to **.svg**, now **ONLY** exports the **current active selection**. (No selection -> export nothing). **Note: Only .svg**
* 'Save-As' supports **selections**. An **active selection** will now **ONLY** save those. (No selection -> save all). **Note: Different to export as above**
* Selected image(s) filename(s) displayed at the bottom of the image(s).
* Selected image filename can be queried via the 'F' hotkey or using the menu system. **Note: Displayed on the notification pop-up**

Regarding the bee file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All images are embedded into the bee file as PNG or JPG. The bee file format is a sqlite database inside which the images are stored in an sqlar table—meaning they can be extracted with the `sqlite command line program <https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html>`_::

  sqlite3 myfile.bee -Axv

Options for exporting from inside BeeRef are planned, but the above always works independently of BeeRef.


Troubleshooting
---------------

You can access the log output via *Help -> Show Debug Log*. In case BeeRef doesn't start at all, you can find the log file here:

Windows:

  C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\BeeRef\BeeRef.log

Linux and MacOS:

  /home/USERNAME/.config/BeeRef/BeeRef.log


Notes for developers
--------------------

BeeRef is written in Python and PyQt6. For more info, see `CONTRIBUTING.rst <https://github.com/rbreu/beeref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
